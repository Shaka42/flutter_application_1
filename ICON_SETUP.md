# App Icon Setup Instructions

## Steps to Set Up Your Custom App Icon

### 1. Save the Icon Image
Save your piggy bank icon image (the one you uploaded) to:
```
assets/images/app_icon.png
```

**Important:** The image should be:
- PNG format
- At least 1024x1024 pixels for best quality
- Square aspect ratio

### 2. Generate the Icons
After saving the image, run this command in the terminal:
```bash
cd /home/sylvan/Desktop/Flutter/Project/flutter_application_1
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This will automatically generate app icons for:
- ✅ Android (all required sizes)
- ✅ iOS (all required sizes)
- ✅ Web
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Linux

### 3. Rebuild Your App
After the icons are generated, rebuild your app to see the new icon:
```bash
flutter run
```

Or for a full clean build:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## What's Already Done
- ✅ `flutter_launcher_icons` package installed
- ✅ Configuration added to `pubspec.yaml`
- ✅ Dependencies updated with `flutter pub get`

## Current Configuration
The icon configuration in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/images/app_icon.png"

## Next Steps
